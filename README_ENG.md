### Ultra is a functional custom firmware for Nintendo Switch, with a focus on overclocking and an improved user experience.

### [Ultra 2.4](https://github.com/Ultra-NX/UltraNX/releases) Supports HOS 20.0.1 and all console revisions



## Features of Ultra

* Pre-configured OC Switchcraft (Successor to OC-Suite) with presets.
* By default, there's already an undervolt that noticeably reduces the console's consumption, and a slight memory overclock that will make games smoother.
* The best overclocking customizer for Switch - Ultra-Tuner, that allows you to customize overclocking right from the console. It was the first, and remains unique.
* The CFW is as light as possible. There are no unnecessary things in it, only minimum necessary for overclocking and comfortable use.
* Modular design. A minimum of applications/plugins/overlays are included, but you can always add more via the Ultra Tuner.
* Manual adjustment of cooling system curves, and presets.
* Regular updates, and an active community.
* [Forks](https://github.com/Ultra-NX/Ultra-Resources/tree/main/patches) (own modifications) of programs and components needed for convenience, security and empowerment:
   * Atmosphere fork with Ultra version in system information, and disabled reports, which usually clogs up the SD card, wastes its resource and breaks the file system.
   * SaltyNX and FPSLocker forks, with support for changing screen refresh rate and with OLED support.
   * Mission Control fork, with the “easter egg” cut out, making the joycons yellow-blue.
   * Status Monitor fork with display of current voltages and unique Micro Overlay modules, whose presets can be changed via Ultra Tuner.
